# Distributed-Coordination-for-Inverter-Air-Conditioner
These codes correspond to the simulation section of the paper "A Distributed Coordinated Framework with Fair Comfort Level Sharing for Inverter Air Conditioner in Auxiliary Services ". The software used is matlab 2021a, there are several files. 

1.TimeDelay.mlx is the simulation file of IACs following the reference power at different time delays.

2.ToleranceCalculator.mlx can calculate the time delay tolerance (Please determine the communication topology and controller parameters first).

3.PrimaryControl.mlx is the simulation file of IACs involved in one frequency support.

4.PeriodicIssue.mlx is a comparison simulation.

These files contain notes about how to use them. If there are any problem, please contact with zhenweiyu@whu.edu.cn
